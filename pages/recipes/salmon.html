            <li>Soak cedar planks for at least 1 hour in warm water.

            <li>Stir together soy sauce, vegetable oil, rice vinegar,
                sesame oil, green onions, ginger, and garlic in a shallow dish.</li>
            <li>Place salmon fillets in soy mixture and turn to coat.
                Cover and marinate for at least 15 minutes,
                or up to 1 hour refrigerated.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat. Place planks on the grill grate.
                Heat planks until they start to smoke and crackle just a little.</li>
            <li>Remove salmon from marinade and place on planks; discard marinade.</li>
            <li>Close grill cover. Grill salmon until it flakes easily with a fork,
