        <h3>(Description) This is a slow cooker french onion soup recipe.
            You will love it!
        </h3>
        
        <p>This slow cooker French onion soup is ridiculously easy to make, mainly since it cooks in a slow cooker! 
            After it's been simmering all day, you come home to an amazing aroma and a fabulous meal for a cold winter day.
             You do not have to caramelize the onions; you can melt the butter in your crockpot, stir in the onions to coat,
              add the remaining ingredients, and cook. 
              However, caramelizing the onions makes for a much, much better soup!</p>
        
        <h4>Ingredients (Serves 8)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>4 large yellow onion, sliced and separated into rings</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cooking sherry</li>
            <li>7 cups reduced-sodium beef broth</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sea salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>8 slices of french bread</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded Gruyere cheese</li>
            <li>1/3 cup shredded Emmental cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup freshly shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat butter in a large, heavy pot over medium-high heat. 
                Add onions; cook and stir until translucent, about 10 minutes. 
                Sprinkle onions with sugar; reduce heat to medium. 
                Cook, stirring constantly, until onions are soft and caramelized, at least 30 minutes. 
                Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir sherry into onion mixture; scrape the bottom to dissolve the small bits of browned food.
                Transfer onions into a slow cooker and pour in beef broth.
                Season with sea salt; stir in thyme and bay leaf.
                Cover and cook on Low for 8 to 10 hours or on High for 4 to 6 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven broiler about 10 minutes before serving.
                Set an oven rack about 8 inches from the heat source.</li>
            <li>Arrange bread slices on a baking sheet; broil until toasted, 1 to 2 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Lightly toss Gruyere, Emmental, Parmesan, and mozzarella cheeses in a bowl.
                Fill oven-safe soup crocks 3/4 full with onion soup and float a bread slice in each bowl.
                Top each with about 2 tablespoons cheese mixture.</li>
            <li>Place filled bowls onto a baking sheet and broil until cheese topping is lightly browned and bubbling, about 2 minutes.</li>       
        </ol>
